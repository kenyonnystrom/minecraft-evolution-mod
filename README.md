# An Adaptive Landscape: Modeling Evolution in Minecraft
This mod endeavors to bring evolution to the hit game Minecraft, specifically introducing various adaptive characteristics to sheep and trees. This is a fork of the [original page](https://github.com/anyaevostinar/minecraft-sheep-evolution) for the purpose of showcasing my contributions. You can learn more about the sheep-related code, of which I was the principal author, in the [original wiki](https://github.com/anyaevostinar/minecraft-sheep-evolution/wiki/Sheep-Overview) (which is incomplete outside of my pages).

Here is a list of files which were principally or entirely written by me, ordered by conceptual complexity:\

Lots of credit to advisor Anya Vostinar and all my teammates!
