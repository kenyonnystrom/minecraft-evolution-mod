# An Adaptive Landscape: Modeling Evolution in Minecraft
This mod endeavors to bring evolution to the hit game Minecraft, specifically introducing various adaptive
characteristics to sheep and trees. This is a fork of the [original page](https://github.com/anyaevostinar/minecraft-sheep-evolution) for the purpose of showcasing
my contributions. You can learn more about the sheep-related code, of which I was the principal author,
in the [original wiki](https://github.com/anyaevostinar/minecraft-sheep-evolution/wiki/Sheep-Overview) (which is incomplete outside of my pages).

Lots of credit to Anya Vostinar and all my teammates!
