# An Adaptive Landscape: Modeling Evolution in Minecraft
This mod endeavors to bring evolution to the hit game Minecraft, specifically introducing various adaptive
characteristics to sheep and trees. For detailed information on the code, please read 
[our wiki](https://github.com/anyaevostinar/minecraft-sheep-evolution/wiki).

## Editing the Mod
To edit the mod, you need IntelliJ, which is an IDE built specifically for developing in Java.
You can download IntelliJ Idea using [this link](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) - the community version is 
enough for this project. You will also need Java 17 to develop on top of this particular project, and you should choose
this version of Java as the default in IntelliJ (File>Project Structure).

Now you can build the project:  click gradle on the right hand side, then under Tasks>build, double click "build".
To actually run the modded game, in the same menu, go to Tasks>fabric and double click "runClient".
